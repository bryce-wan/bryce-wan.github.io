# About Me
Hello! My name is Chenyang Wan (万晨阳), and you can call me Bryce as well. I'm currently a third-year undergraduate student at [College of Control Science and Engineering(CSE)](http://www.cse.zju.edu.cn/cseenglish/main.htm), [Zhejiang University(ZJU)](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/). I also take courses in Advanced Honor Class of Engineering Education(ACEE), [Chu Kochen Honors College](http://ckc.zju.edu.cn/ckcen/_t1906/main.psp) as a minor. 

My research interests include robotics(particularly in robot navigation and trajectory planning), computer vision, and machine learning.

Now I am an internship student in the [Robotics Lab of Zhejiang University](https://github.com/ZJU-Robotics-Lab). My research work focusing on the mutual localization in multi-robot systems and the application of reinforcement learning in robot navigation.
